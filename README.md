# Soda-Fountain

A how-to on building a basic React-Redux app. Since the purpose of the project is to show step-by-step how different functionalities are implemented in a React-Redux app the user will, according to which branch they checkout to, be able to buy one unit of cake at a click / buy one unit of their choice of either cake or ice-cream at a click / buy a selected number of units of their choice of either cake or ice-cream at a click and see the inventory of cake or ice cream diminished in consequence / or the user can see the list of app user names listed as they are fetched from a user api. The project is based on the tutorial video [React Redux Tutorials](https://youtu.be/9boMnm5X9ak?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwheJHvseC3I0HuYI2f46oAK) by "Codevolution."

### Breakdown of Tutorial

The feature branches of the tutorial present versions of the app where specific components or functions
were implemented. 

* `component1-cake` Implements a single component "cakeContainer" which allows the user to be able to buy one unit of cake at a click and see the inventory of cake diminished in consequence.

* `component2-iceCream` Implements a two component "cakeContainer" and "iceCreamContainer" which allow the user to be able to buy one unit of their choice of either cake or ice cream at a click and see the inventory of cake or ice cream diminished in consequence.
